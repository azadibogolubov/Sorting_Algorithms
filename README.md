Sorting Algorithms
==================

My implementations of various sorting algorithms, starting with Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

Examples will be done in Java, and as time permits, other high level languages.

To find an algorithm implementation, navigate to the directory of the algorithm you would like, and run the file. At this time, lists will be hardcoded into the programs for the sake of simplicity.
